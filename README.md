# 🩺 Medical Translator

A web-based application designed to help non-English speakers navigate healthcare systems in the United States. Built with accessibility and empathy in mind, this tool provides medical translations in **Urdu**, **Chinese**, and **Twi**—languages spoken by our team members.

## 🌍 Purpose

Navigating healthcare is hard enough. For immigrants, refugees, and non-native speakers, language barriers can be life-threatening. Our goal is to bridge that gap by offering culturally aware, medically accurate translations that empower patients to advocate for their health.
